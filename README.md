The purpose of this challenge is to introduce you to SciChart (so you can see if it is something you would enjoy working with), to see how quickly you can learn something new, and to assess the quality and style of your code.

> Getting started information is at https://www.scichart.com/getting-started/scichart-javascript/.  

> Docs and tutorials are at https://www.scichart.com/documentation/js/current/webframe.html#SciChart_JS_User_Manual.html  

> Demos with access to source code are at https://demo.scichart.com

Your solution should be a react application and should either be developed directly in codesandbox, or pushed to a github repo that we can load into codesandbox.

Reproduce this chart using SciChart.  Add appropriate standard interactivity modifiers. 

## Attempt at least one of the following:

1. Add some UI in react to control some aspects of the chart. Eg country filter, series color, series type.

2. Create a second chart which shows patent types by country for a particular year. When a column on the main chart is selected, the data for the appropriate year should be shown on the second chart.
